# MoFleet

> [!NOTE]
> Archived for now due lack of research and exploration, already existing idea, etc. Seems protocol from [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) is interesting to be reuse in these purpose; as such, file sharing functionality (FileTK) would not be develop. Need to research about P2P Relay server and pools first.

```sh
dart pub add melos --dev
melos bootstrap

melos run analyze
```
